MAC OS X INSTRUCTIONS
Make sure you have git installed and setup
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
Get the repository
git clone https://github.com/jorshi/seng330
Get python setup
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install PIP for package management, if you don’t have it already. Python 2.7.10 should ship with it included.
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
Install virtualenv
pip install virtualenv
Get Database setup
http://www.postgresql.org/download/
On Mac OS I used postgres.app
Start an instance of postgres
Can check on the command line by running psql, should log you into the postgres command line interface. \q to exit
On windows I believe the equivalent to psql is the postgres executable
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15869808/postgres-psql-command-is-not-recognized-in-windows-environment 
Run the database setup script for the gamesite application
psql < seng330/setup_db.sql
Setup a virtualenv
Navigate in seng330
cd seng330
Create a new virtualenv called venv
virtualenv venv
Activate the virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run migrations to setup DB
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py mapbuilder test03
Will probably ask you to create a superuser, follow prompts to setup a user for yourself
If it doesn’t ask you for a superuser, not a bad idea to do it anyways by running ‘python manage.py createsuperuser’
Start the development server
python manage.py runserver
Should start up and tell you where it is running at (ie. 127.0.0.1:8000)
Open a browser and navigate to the given address
You’ll notice that through all this git sees that you have new untracked files, we want to ignore these.
Create a file called ‘.gitignore’ in the seng330 directory
Add ‘*.pyc’, ‘venv’ & ‘.gitignore’ to this file, in a list separated by new lines
Bravo! Dev environment is ready to go :)

WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS
Install Git (Git For Windows or GitHub Desktop are good choices)
Install Python 2.7 (I installed to C:\Python27 without adding to my PATH)
Run pip:
C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install virtualenv
Install and run Postgres
install Visual C++ compiler for Python: 
install Postgres (enter a password for the postgres account)
Clone the project from GitHub into a folder of your choice
Install project requirements
cd into the project (seng330) and create a virtualenv in it:
C:\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up database
“%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Postgres\bin\psql.exe” -U postgres < setup_db.sql
enter the password you set when installing Postgres
(I’m running 64-bit Windows, omit the (x86) otherwise)
Run the following commands:
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py mapbuilder test03
python manage.py runserver
Should start up and tell you where it is running at (ie. 127.0.0.1:8000)
